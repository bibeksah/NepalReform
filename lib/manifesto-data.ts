The CIAA holds extensive legal authority under Section 19 (particularly Subsections 6 and 8) of the CIAA Act, which allows it to: Seize documents and property relevant to an investigation, Arrest or take into custody accused persons when necessary, and Directly file and prosecute corruption cases before the Special Court without having to route them through the district courts. However, despite these powers, the CIAA's effectiveness is severely undermined by structural and political weaknesses: Politicised leadership where the Chief Commissioner and other member Commissioners are politically appointed and the Chief Commissioner wields sole discretionary power to approve or block cases; Lack of operational independence where CIAA depends on the Ministry of Finance for its budget; Narrowed jurisdiction where the 2015 Constitution removed its authority to investigate 'improper conduct'; Weak institutional capacity with understaffed investigation and prosecution units lacking advanced forensic and digital tools; Absence of prosecutorial standards enabling selective enforcement; and Incomplete asset recovery framework with weak inter-agency coordination limiting actual recoveries."

Simultaneously, weak safeguards fail to protect national interests: no systematic screening for exploitative investment terms, environmental damage, community displacement, or strategic sector vulnerability. The regulatory architecture—Department of Industry for routine approvals, Investment Board for large projects—lacks specialized expertise in investment screening, sectoral analysis, technology evaluation, or community impact assessment. Result: Nepal attracts minimal quality FDI (less than 1% of GDP annually, among South Asia's lowest) while remaining vulnerable to exploitative resource extraction, land grabbing, and projects with minimal technology transfer or local benefit.

This opacity enables systematic corruption: inflated contracts, ghost beneficiaries, fund diversion, and wasteful spending.

Nepal's social protection landscape includes old-age pensions, child grants in select districts, disability allowances, widow support, and contributory social security schemes, but these programs operate in silos without coordination. Coverage gaps leave most working-age population and many children without support. Benefit levels inadequate—often less than 10% of minimum expenditure basket. Informal sector workers (majority of workforce) largely excluded from contributory schemes. No shock-responsive mechanisms for rapid scale-up during disasters despite Nepal's vulnerability to earthquakes, floods, landslides.
